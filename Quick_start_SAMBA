The basics of how to get a project running through SAMBA.
This guide is intended for CIVM users, and will need further adapation for external users.

Firing up SAMBA is done via the bash command (or script):

#!/bin/bash
input_parameters=~/my_startup_file
optional_reservation=
SAMBA_startup ${input_parameters} ${optional_reservation}

*SAMBA_startup may need to be replaced by vba_pipeline_start in some cases.

BUT before doing this, the input parameters file must be created.
