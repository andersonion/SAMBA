The basics of how to get a project running through SAMBA.
This guide is intended for CIVM users, and will need further adapation for external users.

The first step to setting up your run is creating an input parameters file. This can be done from scratch, or input_parameter_template.headfile can be used as a starting point and saved with the name of your choice. This file also acts as a guide as to what are required parameters, which are optional, and which are available but can be ignored.

Headfile entries are straightforward:
variable_1_name=variable_1_string
variable_2_name=variable_2_string
.
.
.
variable_N_name=variable_N_string

Note that the strings CANNOT contain spaces, and quotes are discouraged.  You can have comments starting with "#", but they need to be on their own line.
When listing multiple entries, such as run numbers ("runnos"), separate with commas.

So, let's do that now!

Save a copy of input_parameter_template.headfile and open in your text editor of choice.

Change the project_name appropriately, in the form of 15.rja.01 or 13.mcnamara.02, etc.
Change the optional_suffix to something like nians_test or NataliesTest
Set the group_1_runnos and group_2_runnos.
Leave all other defaults in place.

Save and run the startup commands below!

Firing up SAMBA is done via the bash command (or script):
If scripting, don't forgot your shebang:
#!/bin/bash

input_parameters=~/my_startup_file
optional_slurm_reservation=
SAMBA_startup ${input_parameters} ${optional_slurm_reservation}

# End of script
*SAMBA_startup may need to be replaced by vba_pipeline_start in some cases.
