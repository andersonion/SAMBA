The basics of how to get a project running through SAMBA.
This guide is intended for CIVM users, and will need further adapation for external users.

The first step to setting up your run is creating an input parameters file. This can be done from scratch, or input_parameter_template.headfile can be used as a starting point and saved with the name of your choice. This file also acts as a guide as to what are required parameters, which are optional, and which are available but can be ignored.

For notes on the evolution of the pipeline towards BIDS compatibility, please see the end of this file.  This includes documentation on the participants.tsv file, and initializing the pipeline with .json file instead of a headfile.

Headfile entries are straightforward:
variable_1_name=variable_1_string
variable_2_name=variable_2_string
.
.
.
variable_N_name=variable_N_string

Note that the strings CANNOT contain spaces, and quotes are discouraged.  You can have comments starting with "#", but they need to be on their own line.
When listing multiple entries, such as run numbers ("runnos"), separate with commas.

####
A word about "comparisons" and "template_predictor", etc (any time a group is defined by a criterium):
In the headfile or .json file, this should be a string in the form of, for example:
For .tsv entries that are strings:
"GROUP=control"
"GROUP!=control"
"SEX=m"
"STRAIN=BTBR"

For .tsv entries that are numeric:
"AGE=3"
"TREATMENT<=30" or "TREATMENT=<30" (equivalent)
"WEIGHT<25"
"AGE!=25"
"AGE=(19,20)" # Exclusive range: greater than 19 and less than 20
"AGE=[18,21]" # Inclusive range: greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 21.

Combine as many criteria as one likes:
"AGE<29","WEIGHT<135","SEX=f"


**Note that the fields (AGE,SEX, WEight,treaMent, etc) are case-insensitive**

So, let's do that now!

Save a copy of input_parameter_template.headfile and open in your text editor of choice.

Change the project_name appropriately, in the form of 15.rja.01 or 13.mcnamara.02, etc.
Change the optional_suffix to something like nians_test or NataliesTest
Set the group_1_runnos and group_2_runnos.
Leave all other defaults in place.

Save and run the startup commands below!

Firing up SAMBA is done via the bash command (or script):
If scripting, don't forgot your shebang:
#!/bin/bash

input_parameters=~/my_startup_file
optional_slurm_reservation=
SAMBA_startup ${input_parameters} ${optional_slurm_reservation}

# End of script
*SAMBA_startup may need to be replaced by vba_pipeline_start in some cases.

NOTES ON THE participants.tsv file (also known as matrix of predictors):

The TSV is a Tab-Separated Value file, essentially a CSV with "\t" instead of "," as the separator.
