workstation_code project
Code should contain all the code requied to do workstation duities. 
subdirs contain projects for that purpose  and are fetched via svn:externals properties. 

run install.pl to set up the environment for a new computer.
run svn_extern_update.bash to update all the externals.

the svn:externals are written into .svn.externals for each folder.
the externals are stored in .svn.externals to make maitenance easeier. 
Use svn propset svn:externals -F .svn.externals FOLDERNAME  to udpate.
Use "." for FOLDERNAME from inside a directory for easiest and most predeictable behavior.
