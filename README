workstation_code project
----
After install, code should contain all the code requied to do workstation duities. 
subdirs contain projects for that purpose and are fetched via svn:externals or git properties. 

Main folders and the subversion projects we're using.
analysis      - analysis code, takes an input image or images and 
                runs it through some code and produces 
	        a map image or statistics or both
   /mr_relaxation_calc - t1, t2 t2s calculator
pipeline_settings - settings and folder locations
recon        - reconstruction code folder
   /mat_home - general matlab recon
   /dce?     - bruker radial acq recon and dce calculation 
   /legacy   - radish legacy code structure or support
segmentation - segmenation pipeline code
   /seg_pipe_mc - n channels segmentation pipeline
shared       - shared libraries of things, and utility code
   /pipeline_utilities       - perl libraries 
   /civm_common_matlab_utils - matlab libraries, simple image utils for civm stuff 
                               especially read/write civm format files
   /civm_simple_utils        - small perl modules
   /mathworks                - matlab thirdparty-libs from mathworks
   /matlab_img_processing    - matlab tools for image data, some are in standalone format some are not
diffusion       - diffusion pipelines, tensor calculator for now,
   /tensor_pipe - tensor calculation pipeline



Install errors remaining.
----
mathworks third-party libraries.


Install
----
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED To look at what is happening during the install before running it.
To have a better idea of what is happening examine the contents of the install folder.
THE INSTALLER MUST BE RUN FROM THE WORKSTATION_CODE DIRECTORY.
cd to workstation_code and run install.pl to set up the environment for a new computer or user.

This should try to solve any pre-requsite issues, or warn about what is required.
Some thing just wont work on linux/unix/windows. This is a work in progress.


Adding additional projects
----
sub projects or component projects are handled with .svn.externals files in each directory containing them. 
svn:externals properties are written to the svn server at CIVM using the svn_extern_update.bash script in the workstation_code root directory. 
when using svn(CIVM ONLY), running the command "svn update" while in the workstation_code directory will update any project proplery registerd as an svn external.
run svn_extern_update.bash to properly register all the externals in .svn.externals files.(CIVM ONLY)
if the workstation code is not a svn working directory, all projects are assumed to be on github under JamesJCook and are fetched from there. For any missing projects svn access to the civmsvn server is attempted.

-to udpate a single svn extern manually.
Use svn propset svn:externals -F .svn.externals FOLDERNAME 
Use "." for FOLDERNAME from inside a directory for easiest and most predeictable behavior.
