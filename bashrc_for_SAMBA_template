# Please set these variables before running SAMBA_setup.bash.
# Many thanks, --BJ

# SAMBA_APPS_DIR is the parent directory for all SAMBA-related installations
# It should be readable and executable by all SAMBA users

# BIGGUS_DISKUS is the folder where SAMBA will create folders and do its work.
export BIGGUS_DISKUS=/mnt/newStor/paros/paros_WORK/mouse/


# BIGGUS_DISKUS is also the default location where the folder 'samba_startup_cache'
# will be created, in which upon running, SAMBA will make a copy of any startup headfile
# used to run SAMBA, prepended with the ${USER} who ran it. In most situations, this is ideally
# in a location to which all SAMBA users have read/write permissions.
# To override the parent directory of the cache folder, uncomment and set SAMBA_CACHE_DIR.
# export SAMBA_CACHE_DIR=

# ATLAS_FOLDER should be a readable and writable to all SAMBA users
# SAMBA will look for atlas-specific subfolders here.

# Setting MATLAB_JAVA will make opening and saving gzipped file much quicker.
# But this can be tricky...one needs to know how to compile on the current environment
# the version of Java that MATLAB2015b requires
# Examples:
#export MATLAB_JAVA=/mnt/clustertmp/common/rja20_dev/jres
#export MATLAB_JAVA=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.191.b12-0.el7_5.x86_64/jre

# Control which version of perl we're using
perlbrew switch perl-5.16.3

# If using the default installation paths, these two variables will not need to be changed.
