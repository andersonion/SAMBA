# SAMBA will look for "atlas" folders here.
# Also, a folder called 'samba_startup_cache' will be created here, in which SAMBA will make
# a copy of any startup headfile used to run SAMBA, prepended with ${USER}
# If the atlas folder is in a non-writable location, make this writable location and create symlink
# pointing to the atlas location.
